MVP - 

As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup so that employers will love me.

As the creator, I want the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me and I can build my audience.

As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it and abstract out the details for individual projects.

As a developer, I want my CSS organized (think SMACSS) so that I can find my stylings easily.
