# portfolio

##Version 0.0.1/2

User Stories/Goals -
1) To create a portfolio that takes into consideration the mobile first design aspect
2) To display the portfolio in a functional and informational way that also presents additional style as the page is expanded to large client sizes

Progress:
 - created original wireframing files
 - created physical wireframing with ideas on style
 - Pondered the meaning of life and what I really want to get out of portfolio
 - entered a paradoxical loop


##Version 0.0.1 :  Currently Deployed and Filled with Future Sudo Planned Coding

User Stories/Goals -


MVP -

- As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup so that employers will love me.
- As the creator, I want the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me and I can build my audience.
- As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it and abstract out the details for individual projects.
- As a developer, I want my CSS organized (think SMACSS) so that I can find my stylings easily.


##Version 0.0.3 : Currently Planning Phase: Awaiting Implementation


MVP - TODO:
- As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST.
    - This means your links to NOT navigate to a new page.
    - Instead, your "single page app" shows only the section related to the navigation tab that is selected.
    - You can use data- attributes to associate a content section with a particular tab
    - Then use jQuery so when the tab is clicked, you hide all the sections, then reveal the associated section only.

- As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.
  - Neutral natural colors, using HTML 5 for a background image?

Stretch Goals TODO:
- As a reader, I want project descriptions truncated to the first paragraph on the main page but have a link to the additional projects folder that directs you to that specific project
- As a reader, I want projects filterable by category so that I can review just the things that interest me. (ON THE PROJECTS PAGE)

##Version 0.0.4 : Currently Planning Phase: Awaiting Implementation

MVP - TODO:
- As a developer, I want to use Handlebars for my project template, so that I can include new projects more easily.
- As a developer, I want my CSS styles to follow SMACSS organization, so that I know where to look for creating and editing styles.

Stretch Goals TODO:
- As a visitor, I want the site to use great typography, so that I have an enjoyable reading experience.
  - Set up your h1, h2, h3 elements according to a type scale.
  - Include some good fonts, that work well together.

##Version 0.0.5 : Currently Planning Phase: Awaiting Implementation

MVP - TODO:
- DONE: review each others code and provide constructive feedback
- Items identified and discussed with Dana
  - add project filtering
- remove multiple .html pages and change to a hide/show function on one HTML page
Run data back into a constructor,
- finish the handlebars.js compile
- interesting background - explained idea of splitting projects section to expand with desktop view, Dana gave critique on the idea and implementation

##Version 0.0.6 : Currently Planning Phase: Awaiting Implementation

MVP - TODO:
- As a developer, I want to store my project data in a .json file, so that I can keep it organized.
- As a developer, I want to retrieve that source data file asynchronously, so that my app logic gets the data just when I need it.

Stretch Goals:
- As a reader, I only want to have to fetch data when it's updated (and keep it cached locally), so that I don't make unneeded AJAX calls.
