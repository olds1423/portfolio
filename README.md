##Version 0.0.1

User Stories/Goals -


MVP -

As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup so that employers will love me.

As the creator, I want the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me and I can build my audience.

As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it and abstract out the details for individual projects.

As a developer, I want my CSS organized (think SMACSS) so that I can find my stylings easily.


##Version 0.0.3


MVP - TODO:
- As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST.
    - This means your links to NOT navigate to a new page.
    - Instead, your "single page app" shows only the section related to the navigation tab that is selected.
    - You can use data- attributes to associate a content section with a particular tab
    - Then use jQuery so when the tab is clicked, you hide all the sections, then reveal the associated section only.

- As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.
  - Neutral natural colors, using HTML 5 for a background image?

Stretch Goals TODO:
- As a reader, I want project descriptions truncated to the first paragraph on the main page but have a link to the additional projects folder that directs you to that specific project
- As a reader, I want projects filterable by category so that I can review just the things that interest me. (ON THE PROJECTS PAGE)
